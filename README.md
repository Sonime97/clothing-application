# My Ecommerce Clothing Application built with Flutter
Introduction:
I built a clothing application with flutter using firebase as my backend, replicating the designs and functionality of a modern day ecomerce application.
# The Idea Behind the App:
The idea behind my clothing application was to provide users with a platform where they can browse and purchase the latest fashion trends conveniently from their smartphones. I aimed to create an app that not only offers a visually appealing interface but also ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience.

# Technology Stack:
For this project, I chose Flutter, Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter's hot reload feature, rich widget library, and customizable UI components made it an ideal choice for developing a this  clothing app.
Some of the community packages like :- 

Firebase for my backend
 
Provider for state management

SQFLITE TO STORE the CART data ON THE DEVICE

SharedPreference to persist datat within the application

Flutterwave for payment integration

Google font




 Key Features of the App:
# User-Friendly Interface:
The application boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface, enabling users to easily navigate through different clothing categories and products.
# Authentication
The application uses firebase restapi for authentication
#Product Catalog: (PENDING)
The heart of the app is its product catalog, featuring a wide variety of clothing items ranging from casual wear to formal attire. Each product is showcased with high-quality images and detailed descriptions.

# Search and Filtering:
To enhance the shopping experience, I implemented a search feature that allows users to quickly find specific products. Additionally, I integrated filtering options to narrow down choices based on criteria such as price range, size, and color.

# User Profiles:
Users can create profiles, save their favorite items to a wishlist, and revisit them later. This personalized touch adds to the engagement and user retention aspects of the application.

# Seamless Checkout Process:
The checkout process is designed to be smooth and efficient, with a secure payment gateway integrated to ensure secure transactions.

# Real-time Updates:
To keep users informed about new arrivals, discounts, and promotions, I implemented a real-time update system that sends push notifications.

# Challenges and Solutions:
Prior to this application have never used most of the packages i utilized in this project so it was quite tasking getting them to work as intended for the project, i also didnt have knowledge of SQL but had to use the sqflite package so i learn about the basic practices using Sql.
